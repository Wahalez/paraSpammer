# paraSpammer
**Web URL parameter spammer**

This is a little project that came to my mind while doing ctfs. 
I thought wouldn't it be cool if there was (there probably is) a program that spams url GET parameters. 
For now this program just prints out the iterations in which a search for the regex specified is found.

### Future Ideas\ TODO
- Add an option that a user can promp custom header to send in the request packet. 
- Add option to spam more than 1 parameter.

Use this program at your own risk ..
